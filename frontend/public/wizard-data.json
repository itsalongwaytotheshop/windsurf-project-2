    "Term": "Definition",
    "A\u2013frequency\nweighting": "A frequency based adjustment made to a sound level measurement, by means of an electronic filter, in line with international standards. This approximates the frequency response of the human ear and accounts for reduced sensitivity at low frequency.",
    "Affected Distance": "Distance up to which noise levels are expected to exceed the Noise Management Level as defined by the EPA\u2019s ICNG.",
    "At-receiver treatments": "Includes building treatments and courtyard walls. Building treatments may include but are not limited to ventilation, glazing, window and door seals, sealing of vents and underfloor areas.",
    "Background noise level": "The underlying level of noise present in the ambient noise when extraneous noise is removed and excluding noise from the project under consideration. This is described using the LA90 descriptor.",
    "Decibel (dB)": "A measure of sound level. The decibel is a logarithmic way of describing a ratio. The ratio may be power, sound pressure, voltage, intensity or other parameters. In the case of sound pressure, it is equivalent to 10 times the logarithm (to base 10) of the ratio of a given sound pressure squared to a reference sound pressure squared.",
    "Decibel (A-weighted; dBA)": "Unit used to measure \u2018A-weighted\u2019 sound pressure levels. A-weighting is a frequency based adjustment made to a sound-level measurement to approximate the response of the human ear.",
    "Emergency works": "Unforeseen works immediately needed to prevent the loss of life, damage to property or environmental harm (See EPA's Interim Construction Noise Guideline).",
    "Equitable": "Receivers and communities exposed to road project noise receive consistent outcomes.",
    "Feasibility": "Relates to engineering considerations (what can be practically built). These engineering considerations may include:",
    "Frequency": "The number of times that a vibration or periodic function occurs or repeats itself in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz).",
    "Highly sensitive receiver": "Receiver where standard annoyance and human comfort criteria do not provide sufficient guidance on the impact. Some examples include buildings with sensitive equipment, recording studios and cinemas.",
    "Maintenance": "Any activity permitted under the Environmental assessment procedure for routine and minor works Activity Checklist EIA-P05-G01-T01. \nWorks with the potential to cause operational noise impacts, such as altering a pavement surface type or moving traffic closer to receivers are excluded from this definition.",
    "LAmax": "The \u201cMaximum Noise Level\u201d for an event, used in the assessment of potential sleep disturbance during night-time periods. The subscript \u201cA\u201d indicates that the noise levels are filtered to match normal human hearing characteristics (i.e. A-weighted). \u201cFast\u201d time constant is used for this measurement.",
    "LAeq(15 minute)": "The \u201cEnergy Average Noise Level\u201d during construction activities, evaluated over a measurement period of 15 minutes. This is the main parameter used to assess the construction noise impacts.",
    "LA90": "The A-weighted noise level that is exceeded for 90% of each sampling period when measured in the absence of construction works under consideration and excluding extraneous noise. This is considered to represent the background noise.",
    "Line of sight (LoS)": "The straight line between the noise source and the receiver.",
    "NML": "Noise Management Level as defined by the NSW EPA and in compliance with the ICNG. NMLs may be referred to as noise objectives in this document",
    "Reasonable": "Selecting reasonable measures from those that are feasible involves judging whether the overall noise benefits provide significant social, economic or environmental benefits. The factors to be considered are:",
    "Rating background level (RBL)": "The overall single-figure background noise level ( LA90) for each assessment period. Determination of the rating background level is by the method described in the NSW Noise Policy for Industry (EPA, 2017). This approach aims to result in the noise management level being met for at least 90% of the time periods (15 minute each) over which reactions of annoyance can occur. The LAeq(15 minute) construction noise objectives are based on an allowance margin above the LA90 background noise levels.",
    "Solid barrier": "Solid barriers can be in the form of road cutting, timber lapped and capped fence, shipping container, site office, etc. Please note that vegetation and trees are not considered to be a form of solid barrier and any gaps would compromise the acoustic integrity of the solid barrier.",
    "Substantial solid barrier": "Substantial solid barriers are barriers greater than 5 metres in height or multiple rows of houses or a sound barrier specifically designed to mitigate construction noise with an insertion loss of more than 10 dB(A)."
